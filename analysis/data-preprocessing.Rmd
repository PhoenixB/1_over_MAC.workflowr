## Introduction

## Data preprocessing steps

1. Load data as separate csv files
2. Combine separate data sets into `one_over_mac` data.table object
3. Load Excel files with rejected patients
4. Load separate csv file with age data
5. Combine data sets with age
6. Mark rejected patients in `one_over_mac`
7. Calculate modified z-score from `peak_alpha` per patient and mark scores above 3.5 as outliers
8. Mark `ce_mac` values above 1.5 and below 0.5, which is clinically sensible
9. Calculate range differences of `ce_mac` per patient and mark those below the median
10. Center `ce_mac` group-wise at the mean
11. Filter marked observations
